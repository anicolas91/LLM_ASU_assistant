"Before applying to ASU Online, you should consider the following factors:

1. **Visa Requirements**: If you are an international student residing outside of the U.S., you need to select the visa type 'JN' in your application, as student visas are not available for online students. If you currently reside in the U.S. with an F1 visa, you cannot enroll in online programs.

2. **Financial Considerations**: It's advisable to use the Arizona State University tuition calculator to estimate the potential costs of your degree before applying or enrolling. You can also contact a financial aid counselor for more personalized assistance.

3. **Course Structure**: Most online courses at ASU are offered asynchronously, meaning there are no set log-in times, but some courses may have synchronous components. It’s important to carefully read the syllabus for each class to understand the expectations related to attendance and participation.

4. **Admission Requirements**: If you do not meet the standard admission requirements, consider the Earned Admission track for undergraduate programs, which allows you to gain admission by completing a certain number of credit hours. For graduate programs, you should research specific admission standards or discuss your options with an enrollment coach if not accepted.

5. **Nondegree Options**: You can apply as a nondegree student if you wish to take individual courses for personal enrichment, prerequisites, or transfer purposes. 

6. **Transfer of Credits**: Keep in mind that while ASU Online credits are treated the same as on-campus credits, transfer eligibility depends on the receiving institution.

7. **Previous Applications**: If you were previously accepted into an on-campus program, you do not need to reapply to become an online student as long as you were enrolled.

"The time it takes to complete an online degree at ASU is influenced by several factors, including:

1. **Course Load**: The number of courses you take each semester significantly impacts the duration of your degree. A full-time course load typically consists of 12-15 credit hours per semester and is assumed for the general timeline of four years for a bachelor's degree and about two years for a master's degree.

2. **Credit Hours**: If you take more than the standard number of credit hours per semester, you might complete your degree more quickly. Conversely, taking fewer credit hours or pursuing a part-time schedule will extend the time to graduation.

3. **Transfer Credits**: If you have transfer credits, this could also speed up the completion of your degree.

4. **Concurrent Degrees**: Pursuing multiple degrees simultaneously may increase the time it takes to graduate, depending on how this affects your course load.

5. **Individual Circumstances**: Personal situations, such as work commitments or family needs, can influence how many credits you can take each semester and thereby affect your time to completion.
